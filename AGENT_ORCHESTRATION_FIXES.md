# Agent Orchestration Fixes - Change Summary

## Problem Statement
Two issues were identified in the GeminiAIOrchestrator:
1. The Supervisor Agent was doing all the work instead of orchestrating and delegating to specialist agents
2. The Synthesizer was only creating a README.md file instead of the actual deliverable artifacts

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Supervisor Doing All Work
The `createPlanWithMeta()` function had a minimal prompt that didn't specify:
- Available specialist agents and their capabilities
- That the Supervisor should delegate, not execute
- How to properly assign tasks to appropriate agents
- The fallback logic defaulted all tasks to "Supervisor" when parsing failed

### Issue 2: Only README Output
The `synthesizeFinalArtifactWithMeta()` function had a vague prompt that:
- Didn't emphasize creating actual deliverables
- Didn't provide examples of proper artifact creation
- Allowed the AI to just summarize work instead of producing outputs

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Enhanced Plan Creation (`createPlanWithMeta`)

**Changes:**
1. **Improved Prompt**: Added detailed instructions including:
   - List of available specialist agents with their capabilities:
     - Web Researcher: Search, gather information, research topics
     - Data Analyst: Analyze data, create visualizations, statistics
     - Report Writer: Write reports, documentation, summaries
     - Code Generator: Write code in various languages
     - GitHub Tool User: Interact with GitHub repositories
   
   - Clear directive: "DO NOT assign tasks to 'Supervisor' - you should only plan and delegate"
   - Expected JSON format with step, task, agent, and dependencies fields
   
2. **JSON Parsing Enhancement**: 
   - Extract JSON from markdown code blocks if present
   - Better error handling for malformed responses
   
3. **Agent Assignment Validation**:
   - Post-processing to check if any task is assigned to "Supervisor"
   - Intelligent fallback that infers the appropriate agent from task description:
     - Tasks with "code/script/program" → Code Generator
     - Tasks with "research/search/web" → Web Researcher
     - Tasks with "analyze/data/statistics" → Data Analyst
     - Tasks with "write/report/document" → Report Writer
     - Tasks with "github/repository/repo" → GitHub Tool User
     - Default to Report Writer for general tasks

### Fix 2: Enhanced Artifact Synthesis (`synthesizeFinalArtifactWithMeta`)

**Changes:**
1. **Improved Prompt**: Added explicit instructions:
   - "Create the ACTUAL artifacts that fulfill the user's original goal"
   - "DO NOT just create a README.md summary - create the actual deliverables"
   - Specific guidance for different artifact types (code, HTML, data, reports)
   - Examples of proper multi-file outputs
   
2. **JSON Extraction**: Handle markdown code block wrapping
   
3. **Validation**: Warning log if only a README is produced

### Fix 3: Enhanced Step Execution (`executeStep`)

**Changes:**
1. Added agent-specific guidance for each specialist:
   - Web Researcher: "provide detailed findings with sources and citations"
   - Data Analyst: "provide thorough analysis with insights"
   - Report Writer: "create well-structured, complete documents"
   - Code Generator: "write complete, working code with proper syntax"
   - GitHub Tool User: "work with repository data effectively"

2. Emphasized "deliver the actual work product" not summaries or placeholders

## Testing

Created `test-agent-orchestration.ts` with three test suites:
1. **testPlanAgentAssignment**: Verifies tasks are assigned to correct specialist agents
2. **testNoSupervisorWork**: Confirms no tasks are assigned to Supervisor
3. **testArtifactDiversity**: Validates multiple artifacts are created, not just README

All tests pass successfully.

## Impact

**Before:**
- All tasks assigned to "Supervisor" agent
- Output was typically a single README.md with a summary/report

**After:**
- Tasks properly delegated to specialist agents based on their expertise
- Output includes actual deliverable artifacts (HTML files, code files, data files, etc.)
- README.md may be included as documentation but not as the sole output

## Files Modified

1. `src/geminiService.ts`:
   - `createPlanWithMeta()`: Enhanced prompt and added validation logic
   - `executeStep()`: Added agent-specific guidance
   - `synthesizeFinalArtifactWithMeta()`: Enhanced prompt with explicit examples

## Files Added

1. `src/test-agent-orchestration.ts`: Test suite to verify the fixes

## Build Verification

- All changes compile successfully with TypeScript
- Build completes without errors
- No breaking changes to existing API
