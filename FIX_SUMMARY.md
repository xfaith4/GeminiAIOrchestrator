# Fix Summary: Agent Orchestration Issues

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Supervisor Agent Doing All Work ✅
**Problem:** All tasks were being assigned to and executed by the Supervisor Agent instead of being delegated to specialist agents.

**Root Cause:** The `createPlanWithMeta()` function had a minimal prompt that:
- Didn't list available specialist agents
- Didn't instruct the Supervisor to delegate
- Defaulted to "Supervisor" agent when parsing failed

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the prompt with detailed descriptions of 5 specialist agents:
  - **Code Generator**: Write code in various languages
  - **Web Researcher**: Search and gather information
  - **Data Analyst**: Analyze data and create visualizations
  - **Report Writer**: Write documentation and reports
  - **GitHub Tool User**: Interact with GitHub repositories
- Added explicit instruction: "DO NOT assign tasks to 'Supervisor' - you should only plan and delegate"
- Implemented validation to reassign tasks if they're incorrectly assigned to Supervisor
- Added intelligent fallback that infers the appropriate agent from task keywords

### 2. Only README.md Output ✅
**Problem:** The orchestrator was only producing a README.md file with a summary/status report instead of actual deliverable artifacts.

**Root Cause:** The `synthesizeFinalArtifactWithMeta()` function had a vague prompt that didn't emphasize creating actual work products.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the prompt with explicit instructions:
  - "Create the ACTUAL artifacts that fulfill the user's original goal"
  - "DO NOT just create a README.md summary - create the actual deliverables"
- Added concrete examples for different scenarios:
  - HTML page goal → index.html + README.md
  - Data analysis goal → analysis.json + summary.md
  - Python script goal → script.py + README.md
- Implemented JSON extraction from markdown code blocks
- Added warning if only README is produced

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **src/geminiService.ts** (3 functions enhanced):
   - `createPlanWithMeta()`: Lines 92-197
     - Enhanced prompt with agent descriptions and delegation rules
     - Added JSON extraction from code blocks
     - Added validation and intelligent agent inference
   
   - `executeStep()`: Lines 199-225
     - Added agent-specific guidance for better outputs
     - Emphasized delivering actual work products
   
   - `synthesizeFinalArtifactWithMeta()`: Lines 266-335
     - Enhanced prompt with examples and explicit instructions
     - Added JSON extraction and validation

### Files Added
1. **src/test-agent-orchestration.ts**: 
   - Comprehensive test suite with 3 test categories
   - All tests pass successfully
   
2. **AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_FIXES.md**: 
   - Detailed documentation of changes

## Testing & Validation

✅ **Unit Tests**: All 3 test suites pass
- Plan agent assignment test (5/5 cases)
- No Supervisor work test
- Artifact diversity test

✅ **Build**: Successful compilation with no errors

✅ **Code Review**: No issues found

✅ **Security Scan**: CodeQL passed with 0 alerts

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before Fix:
```json
[
  {
    "step": 1,
    "task": "Create HTML structure",
    "agent": "Supervisor",  ❌ Wrong!
    "dependencies": []
  },
  {
    "step": 2,
    "task": "Add styling",
    "agent": "Supervisor",  ❌ Wrong!
    "dependencies": [1]
  }
]

// Output:
[
  {
    "name": "README.md",  ❌ Only a summary!
    "content": "## Workspace Synthesis Report\nThis workspace was synthesized..."
  }
]
```

### After Fix:
```json
[
  {
    "step": 1,
    "task": "Create HTML structure",
    "agent": "Code Generator",  ✅ Correct!
    "dependencies": []
  },
  {
    "step": 2,
    "task": "Add styling",
    "agent": "Code Generator",  ✅ Correct!
    "dependencies": [1]
  }
]

// Output:
[
  {
    "name": "index.html",  ✅ Actual deliverable!
    "content": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>..."
  },
  {
    "name": "styles.css",  ✅ Actual deliverable!
    "content": "body { margin: 0; ... }"
  },
  {
    "name": "README.md",  ✅ Documentation (optional)
    "content": "# Project Documentation\n..."
  }
]
```

## No Breaking Changes

The changes are backward compatible:
- Same function signatures
- Same return types
- Enhanced prompts improve output quality without changing API
- All existing code continues to work

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx -e "import { runAllTests } from './src/test-agent-orchestration.ts'; runAllTests();"
   ```

3. **Start the dev server** (requires API key):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Then try a goal like "Create a simple HTML page" and verify:
   - Tasks are assigned to "Code Generator" not "Supervisor"
   - Output includes index.html file with actual content

## Conclusion

Both issues have been successfully resolved with minimal code changes focused on improving the AI prompts and adding validation logic. The orchestrator now properly delegates work to specialist agents and produces actual deliverable artifacts instead of just summaries.
