# Agentic Workflow Orchestrator v2

An advanced agentic system where a supervisor agent creates a plan to achieve a goal. Specialized agents execute the plan step-by-step, using a shared scratchpad for memory, with a reviewer agent ensuring quality at each stage.

This project is a web-based demonstration of a multi-agent AI system designed to tackle complex tasks through collaboration and self-correction.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Goal-Oriented Planning:** You provide a high-level goal, and a **Supervisor** agent breaks it down into a logical, step-by-step plan.
-   **File-based Context:** Upload documents (`.docx`), spreadsheets (`.xlsx`, `.csv`), data files (`.json`), and scripts to provide rich context for your goal.
-   **Specialized Agents & Tool Use:** The plan is executed by a team of specialized agents. Some agents think (e.g., `Report Writer`), while others act by using tools (e.g., the `GitHub Tool User` can read from public repositories).
-   **Stateful Memory (Scratchpad):** Agents share a common "scratchpad" where the results of each step are stored, providing context for subsequent steps.
-   **Quality Assurance & Self-Correction:** A **Reviewer** agent inspects the output of each step. If the quality is low, it provides feedback, and the original agent attempts the task again, learning from its mistake.
-   **Transparent Process:** The entire workflow, including the plan, agent activities, and the scratchpad, is visualized in real-time, offering a clear view into the AI's "thinking" process.
-   **Interactive Workflow:** The user must approve the generated plan before execution begins, providing a "human-in-the-loop" checkpoint.
-   **Multi-File Workspace:** The final output is a complete workspace of artifacts (e.g., a Markdown report, a Python script, a JSON data file), not just a single response.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The orchestration follows a structured, multi-step process:

1.  **Goal Input:** The user provides a high-level goal and optional context files.
2.  **Plan Generation:** The **Supervisor** agent analyzes the goal and creates a detailed execution plan, including dependencies between steps.
3.  **Plan Approval:** The user reviews the plan and approves it for execution.
4.  **Step Execution:** The **Orchestrator** executes each step in sequence. For each step:
    a. A specialized agent is assigned the task.
    b. The agent performs its task, potentially using a tool (like reading a GitHub repo).
    c. The **Reviewer** agent checks the output for quality. If rejected, the step is retried with the reviewer's feedback.
5.  **Synthesis:** Once all steps are complete, the **Synthesizer** agent reviews the entire process log (the scratchpad) and creates a final, coherent multi-file workspace.

## ü§ñ The Agent Library

The system is composed of several distinct agents, each with a specific role:

-   **Supervisor:** The project manager. Creates the initial plan.
-   **Web Researcher:** Searches the web for information.
-   **Data Analyst:** Analyzes data and performs calculations.
-   **Report Writer:** Synthesizes information into well-structured reports.
-   **Code Generator:** Writes, analyzes, and explains code.
-   **GitHub Tool User:** Interacts with public GitHub repositories.
-   **Reviewer:** The quality assurance expert. Approves or revises step outputs.
-   **Synthesizer:** The final editor. Creates the polished end product.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

-   **Sequential Execution:** The orchestrator processes one step at a time and does not yet support parallel task execution.
-   **GitHub Tool Constraints:** The code review tool works only on public repositories and analyzes a maximum of 5 files. It cannot clone repositories or execute code.
-   **Stateless Sessions:** Each run is independent. The agents have no long-term memory of past goals.
-   **Demonstration Tool:** This application is for demonstration purposes. Do not input sensitive or confidential information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **Syntax Highlighting:** Prism.js
-   **Markdown Rendering:** Marked.js
