# Agentic Workflow Orchestrator v2

An advanced agentic system where a supervisor agent creates a plan to achieve a goal. Specialized agents execute the plan step-by-step, using a shared scratchpad for memory, with a reviewer agent ensuring quality at each stage.

This project is a web-based demonstration of a multi-agent AI system designed to tackle complex tasks through collaboration and self-correction.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, or to deploy it to a live system.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js & npm:** While not strictly required for a simple server, `npx` is used in the instructions. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). A simple Python server also works.
-   **Git:** Required to clone the repository.
-   **Google Gemini API Key:** The application uses the Gemini API to power its agents. You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### üîë API Key Configuration

This application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

1.  **Open the file `services/geminiService.ts`**.
2.  At the very top of the file, you will find a placeholder constant:
    ```typescript
    const API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"; 
    ```
3.  **Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"`** with your actual Google Gemini API key.
4.  **Save the file.**

**‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:** Never commit your API key directly to your Git repository, especially if it's public. The methods described below for deployment involve embedding the key in the client-side code, which is not a secure practice for production applications. This is acceptable only for this demonstration tool, preferably in a private repository.

### Option 1: Running Locally (Recommended)

Running a local development server is the most secure and recommended way to use this tool.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Configure your API Key:**
    Follow the **API Key Configuration** steps listed above.

3.  **Launch the local server:**
    From your terminal in the project's root directory, run one of the following commands:
    ```bash
    # Using npx (part of npm)
    npx serve
    ```
    or if you have Python 3 installed:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Now you can open your browser and navigate to the local address provided (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:8000`).

### Option 2: Deploying to GitHub Pages

You can host this static application for free on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    Push the project files to a new repository on your GitHub account. For security, it is highly recommended that you make this repository **private**.

2.  **Embed your API Key:**
    Follow the same **API Key Configuration** steps above to hardcode your API key into the `services/geminiService.ts` file. This is necessary because GitHub Pages has no backend to securely store the key.
    -   Commit this change and push it to your repository.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    -   In your GitHub repository, go to `Settings` > `Pages`.
    -   Under "Build and deployment", select the `Source` as `Deploy from a branch`.
    -   Choose the `main` branch (or whichever branch you are using) and the `/ (root)` folder. Click `Save`.
    -   After a few minutes, your site will be live at the URL provided by GitHub.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Goal-Oriented Planning:** You provide a high-level goal, and a **Supervisor** agent breaks it down into a logical, step-by-step plan.
-   **File-based Context:** Upload documents (`.docx`), spreadsheets (`.xlsx`, `.csv`), data files (`.json`), and scripts to provide rich context for your goal.
-   **Specialized Agents & Tool Use:** The plan is executed by a team of specialized agents. Some agents think (e.g., `Report Writer`), while others act by using tools (e.g., the `GitHub Tool User` can read from public repositories).
-   **Stateful Memory (Scratchpad):** Agents share a common "scratchpad" where the results of each step are stored, providing context for subsequent steps.
-   **Quality Assurance & Self-Correction:** A **Reviewer** agent inspects the output of each step. If the quality is low, it provides feedback, and the original agent attempts the task again, learning from its mistake.
-   **Transparent Process:** The entire workflow, including the plan, agent activities, and the scratchpad, is visualized in real-time, offering a clear view into the AI's "thinking" process.
-   **Interactive Workflow:** The user must approve the generated plan before execution begins, providing a "human-in-the-loop" checkpoint.
-   **Multi-File Workspace:** The final output is a complete workspace of artifacts (e.g., a Markdown report, a Python script, a JSON data file), not just a single response.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The orchestration follows a structured, multi-step process:

1.  **Goal Input:** The user provides a high-level goal and optional context files.
2.  **Plan Generation:** The **Supervisor** agent analyzes the goal and creates a detailed execution plan, including dependencies between steps.
3.  **Plan Approval:** The user reviews the plan and approves it for execution.
4.  **Step Execution:** The **Orchestrator** executes each step in sequence. For each step:
    a. A specialized agent is assigned the task.
    b. The agent performs its task, potentially using a tool (like reading a GitHub repo).
    c. The **Reviewer** agent checks the output for quality. If rejected, the step is retried with the reviewer's feedback.
5.  **Synthesis:** Once all steps are complete, the **Synthesizer** agent reviews the entire process log (the scratchpad) and creates a final, coherent multi-file workspace.

## ü§ñ The Agent Library

The system is composed of several distinct agents, each with a specific role:

-   **Supervisor:** The project manager. Creates the initial plan.
-   **Web Researcher:** Searches the web for information.
-   **Data Analyst:** Analyzes data and performs calculations.
-   **Report Writer:** Synthesizes information into well-structured reports.
-   **Code Generator:** Writes, analyzes, and explains code.
-   **GitHub Tool User:** Interacts with public GitHub repositories.
-   **Reviewer:** The quality assurance expert. Approves or revises step outputs.
-   **Synthesizer:** The final editor. Creates the polished end product.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

-   **Sequential Execution:** The orchestrator processes one step at a time and does not yet support parallel task execution.
-   **GitHub Tool Constraints:** The code review tool works only on public repositories and analyzes a maximum of 5 files. It cannot clone repositories or execute code.
-   **Stateless Sessions:** Each run is independent. The agents have no long-term memory of past goals.
-   **Demonstration Tool:** This application is for demonstration purposes. Do not input sensitive or confidential information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
-   **Syntax Highlighting:** Prism.js
-   **Markdown Rendering:** Marked.js
